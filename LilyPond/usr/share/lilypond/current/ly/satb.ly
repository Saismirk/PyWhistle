  This file may be \include'd in a score to provide the
  context structure for a score arrangement consisting
  of the following staves:

  Solo Staff (outside Choir grouping)
  Descant Staff (within Choir grouping)
  Women Staff (single voice on one staff)
  Soprano and Alto (optionally on two Staves or one Staff each)
  Multiple verses (up to 9)
  Tenor and Bass (optionally on two Staves or one Staff each)
  Men Staff (single voice on one staff)
  Piano Staff

  It is intended primarily to hide the complexity of the context
  structure from newcomers to LilyPond, but is also useful as a
  shorthand for seasoned users.

  Usage:

  satb.ly should be included at the *end* of the input file. Before
  it are placed the required music and lyrics by redefining specific
  variables, like this:

  \paper { ... }
  \header { ... }
  Key = { ... }
  Time = { ... }
  SoloMusic = \relative { ... }
  DescantMusic = \relative { ... }
  DescantLyrics = \lyricmode { ... }
  WomenMusic = \relative { ... }
  WomenLyrics = \lyricmode { ... }
  SopranoMusic = \relative { ... }
  SopranoLyrics = \lyricmode { ... }
  AltoMusic = \relative { ... }
  AltoLyrics = \lyricmode { ... }
  VerseOne = \lyricmode { ... }
  VerseTwo = \lyricmode { ... }
  ...
  VerseNine = \lyricmode { ... }
  TenorMusic = \relative { ... }
  TenorLyrics = \lyricmode { ... }
  BassMusic = \relative { ... }
  BassLyrics = \lyricmode { ... }
  MenMusic = \relative { ... }
  MenLyrics = \lyricmode { ... }
  PianoRHMusic = \relative { ... }
  PianoDynamics = { ... }
  PianoLHMusic = \relative { ... }
  TwoVoicesPerStaff = ##f
  \include "satb.ly"

  All of the definitions are optional. Staves with no music will be
  omitted from the output.

  Other variables, such as the instrumentName, shortInstrumentName
  and MidiInstrument can also be changed by defining variables like
  AltoInstrumentName, BassMidiInstrument, etc.  The prefixes for staves
  containing two divided voices are WomenDivided and MenDivided, hence
  the corresponding variables would be WomenDividedInstrumentName, etc.
  The key is defined in the variable Key, and the structure of time
  and repeats in the variable Time, using spacer rests.

  A \layout block may be defined in the variable Layout.  There is
  no default \header block and no default \paper block.

  Music may be tagged with #'print or #'play to be included only in
  the printed score or in the MIDI file respectively.
