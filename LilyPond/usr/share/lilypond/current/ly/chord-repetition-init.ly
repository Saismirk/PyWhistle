\version "2.19.22"
%{
  Chord repetition behavior is not customizable in the parser.  That
  is due to it usually being done by the toplevel music handler
  affecting every bit of music at the same time, not closely related
  to music input.  Customized behavior is instead accomplished by
  calling \chordRepeats explicitly on some music list with a list of
  event types you wish to keep by default (if any events of that kind
  are found already on the repeat chord, however, they still get
  removed from the original).

  The default behavior is straightforward: don't keep anything but the
  rhythmic events themselves.
